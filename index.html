	<h5 style = 'color:#009999;'><b> What is a Cryosphere? </b></h5>
	<p> The cryosphere encompasses the parts of the world where water is frozen.
		This includes frozen water on land— ice sheets, glaciers,
		 snow, and frozen ground (permafrost)— as well as sea ice, lake ice, and river ice.</p>

	<h5> Includes: </h5>
		 <br>
		 <dl>
			 <br>
			<p> <b> Glaciers </b></p>

			 <dd>
				 <p>
					 Are slowly moving masses or river of ice formed by the accumulation and
				 compaction of snow on mountains or near the poles
			 </p>
			 </dd>

			 <p><b> Ice Sheets </b></p>

			 <dd>
				 <p>
					Are permanent layers of ice covering an extensive tract of land, especially
				  a polar region
				</p>
			</dd>
					<p><b> Snowpacks </b></p>
			 <dd>
				 <p>
					 Are masses of snow that have been compresssed and hardened by its own weight
				 </p>
			 </dd>
	 	 </dl>

		 <h5 style = 'color:#009999;'><b> What if our Local Cryosphere Disappeared? </b></h5>
<dl>
		 <br>
		 <p>
			 We depend on the cryosphere for access to food, water, and shelter</p>

			 <br>
			<h5> <p>How?</p></h5>

			 	 <dd>
				 <p><b><br>Food/Water</b></p>

					 <p>
						 In Canada, one of the largest food sector exports is fish. Both the Fishing
						 and Agricultural industries reply on our cryospheres. If these areas melt, it
						 leads to nutrient leaching in the soil making it less habitable to certain crops.
						 <br>
						 <br>
						 Nutrient runoff from increased water levels also deposits more Phosphorus into the
						 water leading to eutriphication, and alterations to the water's turbidity. This destroys
						 the habitat for the fish living in surrounding areas.
					 </p>

				 <p><b>Shelter</b></p>
				 		 <p>
							 Costal settlements are also put at risk for floods and damage to the integrity of their
							 infrastructures.
						 </p>

				 </dd>
</dl>


		 <p>This means there is both and ecological and economic incentive to mitigate the negative impact we have on our environment and cryospheres.</p>
